# CSC_493_Travel_Chatbot
One of the consequences of the ongoing pandemic is that it has made domestic and international travel much more complicated. Travelers now have to research each countries COVID restrictions and have to dig through convoluted and messy government websites to find what restrictions they have in place. 
We are proposing a chatbot that can assist travelers and deliver them accurate information regarding COVID-19 restrictions and cases of a respective country. 
This chatbot will support natural language and will be built with Microsoft Azureâ€™s bot SDK.
