Ethiopia,"Latest News: 
 <br>
 <br>
 International Restrictions:<br>
*Entry to Ethiopia: There are special measures in place at all borders when entering Ethiopia. Proof of a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test result issued within the previous 120 hours (5 days), starting from the time the sample is given, is required for all air passengers over the age of 10 years entering Ethiopia. Arrivals must then complete 7 days mandatory self-quarantine. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
*Transiting Ethiopia: Transit passengers are those with an onward ticket to another destination, who do not formally enter Ethiopia. Transiting passengers are exempt from the current quarantine restrictions for COVID-19. The maximum transit time is 72 hours. <br>
While you don’t need a negative COVID-19 test to transit Addis Ababa, you should ensure that you have the correct tests for your onward journey.<br>
Passengers transiting for 24 hours or less can remain in the departure lounge of the airport. For transits over 24 hours, you will be taken to a designated transit hotel for the duration of your stay. On arrival in Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, you should report to the transit desk to confirm your hotel details. After health screening and immigration you will then need to present your hotel details and passport to the desk marked “transit shuttle bus” from where you will be taken to the hotel. You will not be able to leave the hotel during your transit. To the extent airline schedules allow, you should therefore minimise the duration of your transit in Addis Ababa. <br>
Passengers transiting Addis Ababa Bole International Airport are subject to COVID-19 screening measures during transit. See below. If you have any further questions, you should contact your airline. <br>
*Screening on arrival: Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (and other international airports) have put in place measures to screen passengers arriving, departing or transiting through Ethiopia. Screening may include checking COVID-19 test results, temperature measurements, completing a health screening questionnaire and answering questions from health officials on recent travel and your accommodation details for your self-isolation (see Quarantine requirements below). <br>
Anyone who is suspected of having COVID-19 will be taken to a government designated isolation centre where they will receive appropriate follow-up care and will be tested. They will likely have to remain in isolation until they test negative. Any person that tests positive for COVID-19 may be prohibited from entering Ethiopia. Anyone with a pre-existing condition that requires regular medicines should bring sufficient amounts to cover a potential unplanned additional 2 week stay. <br>
*COVID-19 Test and Quarantine requirements: Proof of a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test result issued within the previous 120 hours (5 days), starting from the time the sample is given, is required for all air passengers over the age of 10 years entering Ethiopia (except diplomats). Only RT PCR tests will be accepted. You may need to demonstrate you have such a test certificate before boarding your flight. <br>
You will need to complete 7 days mandatory self-isolation on arrival. You must provide the address for your self-isolation upon arrival. However, passengers who have a certificate of recovery from COVID -19 within the last 90 days or have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 are not required to self-isolate. <br>
Diplomats are encouraged to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate as above. If they do not present a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test certificate, they will be expected to get an RT PCR or Antigen-Based COVID-19 test upon arrival. If the result is negative, they will not be required to self-isolate. If diplomats do not present a negative test certificate or refuse to get the test on arrival, they will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
*Land border quarantine: Measures are in place when arriving into the country across land borders. Those crossing with a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate dated within the previous 120 hours (5 days) with digital reference code (see Entry to Ethiopia) will be screened for symptoms and required to self-isolate at home for 7 days. Those that do not present a negative test certificate will be screened and required to self-isolate for 14 days. Only PCR tests will be accepted. <br>
Anyone who has a certificate of recovery from COVID -19 within 90 days or who has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will not be required to complete 7 days self-quarantine. Anyone who is suspected of having COVID-19 will be taken to a government designated isolation centre where they will receive appropriate follow-up care and a further test.

 <br>
 International Restrictions: <br>
 *Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19): The Fiji government has announced changes to international travel due to Covid-19. Whether entry will be permitted to Fiji and what the process is on arrival will depend on individual circumstances but the major consideration is the countries you have visited or transited in the ten days prior to entering Fiji. Fiji has placed all countries into one of three categories: <a href=""https://www.mcttt.gov.fj/home/traveltofiji/international-travel/"">“Travel Partner” countries</a>, which includes the UK; <a href=""https://www.mcttt.gov.fj/home/traveltofiji/international-travel/"">“Non-Travel Partner” countries</a>; and <a href=""https://www.health.gov.fj/red-list-countries/"">“Red-List” countries</a>. Full information on the latest rules is available from <a href=""https://www.mcttt.gov.fj/international-travel/"">the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport  </a> and you should familiarise yourself carefully with these. In some cases approval prior to travel must be sought. <br>
A pre-departure coronavirus RT-PCR test is required for all travel to Fiji. The Fiji government has reduced the time when this test can be taken to no more than one day prior to the scheduled day of departure or the first flight in a series of connections booked on the same itinerary. This change is now in effect for those departing from the UK and USA. <b>
Only fully vaccinated travellers are able to enter Fiji and the vaccine must be of a type approved by the Fijian authorities. You will also need to ensure you meet testing and vaccination requirements of your airline and any countries transited enroute to Fiji. <br>
Fiji government requires travellers coming for tourist purposes to have medical travel insurance that covers COVID-19. You may transit Nadi Airport from Travel Partner countries if you have a valid ticket, negative COVID-19 test and are fully vaccinated. <br>
All foreign nationals who are currently unable to leave Fiji have been advised to contact Fiji Immigration Office so that they may be properly guided to maintain their legal status. This applies to all categories of permit holders. <br>
These restrictions supersede the regular entry requirements set out below which refer to Fiji’s requirements that existed before the border was closed. <br>

 Internal Restrictions: <br>
*COVID-19 restrictions: Both the vaccinated and unvaccinated must continue to adhere to basic non-pharmaceutical guidelines, such as social distancing, wearing masks in enclosed spaces, and regularly ventilating indoor spaces. Wearing a medical-grade mask remains a legal requirement in retail outlets and on public transport. <br>
From 23 August proof of vaccination, recovery from infection or a negative test (up to 24hrs old for rapid antigen testing or 48 hrs old for PCR testing) will be required for entry into: <br>
•        Hospitals and social care settings<br>
•        Indoor gastronomy<br>
•        Participating in events and celebrations<br>

•        Indoor sport such as fitness studios, swimming baths or sports halls<br>
•        Hotels (test at arrival and twice a week during the stay)<br>
Children five years old and above are exempt from domestic testing requirements. As school pupils are regularly tested at school, they only need to show their school pupil card to prove their C-19 status. Individual States are able to forgo the above rules under certain circumstances, including where the incidence rate is below 35.<br>
The fully vaccinated can demonstrate their status by either using yellow vaccination booklets ‘Impfpass’ which contain a doctor’s signature and stamp or two C-19 certification apps (the CovPass-App or the Corona-Warn-App; see below). Other vaccination certification is accepted for domestic purposes in both electronic and analogue form as long as it has:<br>
•        The date of vaccination;<br>
•        Name and batch name of the vaccine;<br>
•        Name of the disease against which vaccination was given;<br>
•        Name of the person vaccinated, their date of birth and the name and address of the person responsible for administering the vaccination, and;<br>
•        Confirmation in writing or in electronic form with a qualified electronic signature or a qualified electronic seal by the person responsible for administering the vaccination.<br>
Those who have recently recovered from Covid must show a positive PCR test at least 28 days old but no older than six months.<br>
From 11 October 2021 rapid antigen tests will be no longer be available free of charge. For those who have not been recommended for vaccination, such as pregnant women or children under the age of 18, tests will remain free of charge.<br>
Additional rules apply in settings that can cause super-spreader events, such as mass gatherings, events in enclosed spaces, parties, bars and clubs. State and local authorities can restrict capacity at such venues. The 16 German States have agreed to restrict mass sporting events to 50% capacity above 5,000 participants and not exceed a total of 25,000 participants.<br>
As rules may vary please check the latest <a href=""https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/corona-bundeslaender-1745198"">local guidance</a>

*Testing positive for COVID-19 in Germany: Anyone testing positive with a Point of Care (PoC) antigen test is required to take a follow-up PCR test immediately and to self-isolate. Close contacts are also required to self-isolate, although exceptions may apply for those who are fully vaccinated. <br>
In the event of a positive PoC test, the test provider is required to notify the local health office (Gesundheitsamt), which is responsible for monitoring self-isolation and will provide further guidance in individual cases. You can find your local health office by postcode <a href=""https://tools.rki.de/plztool/"">here</a>. <br>
Individuals testing positive must self-isolate in their home or where they are staying locally, or in another appropriate location enabling self-isolation. They may only leave their home and interrupt self-isolation to carry out the PCR test. Germany does not operate a system of managed quarantine in government facilities. <br>
Mandatory self-isolation ceases in the event of a negative PCR test. Otherwise self-isolation lasts for 14 days, or until the local health office confirms release. <br>

Ghana,"Latest News: 
  <br>
  <br>
International Restrictions:<br>
*Entry to Ghana: Kotoka International Airport is open. Commercial flights are operating to and from Ghana. Check with your travel company for the latest information. Land and sea borders remain closed. COVID-19 protocols at the airport may be subject to change as the new screening process evolves. See the guidance from the <a href=""http://www.gcaa.com.gh/web/?page_id=1172"">Ghana Civil Aviation Authority</a>.<br>
All persons 18 years and over arriving into Ghana are required to provide evidence of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The Ghana Health Service defines a fully vaccinated person as someone who has taken the full dose of vaccines approved and registered by the Food and Drugs Authority of Ghana. This is one dose of Johnson and Johnson, or two doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna or Sputnik V.<br>
Passengers travelling to Ghana must additionally:<br>
•        undergo a COVID test 72hrs before departure<br>
•        complete additional health declaration forms<br>
•        undergo a further COVID test on arrival.<br>
The only exemption to the need to provide a pre arrival test is if you are returning to Ghana within one week of leaving.<br>
*Coronavirus tests before departure: On 21 April 2021, the Government of Ghana introduced the mandatory digitisation of all COVID-19 tests for international air travel, with the implementation of the Trusted Travel Scheme. Passengers travelling to Ghana are now required to:<br>
1.        Take a Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID test with one of the listed providers within 72 hours of departure. There is a certified list of providers on https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/ but Port Health staff will check only the type of test taken on arrival. <br>
2.        Create an account at https://trustedtravel.panabios.org/ with the same email address and mobile telephone number you give your PCR test provider. Log on and select check-in; select UK and Ghana as your departure and destination countries; select lab tests (TT); select the matching lab test from the drop down options; click save; provide your flight and passport details as requested; click save to generate a Travel Code (TC); your TC code is then generated for you to copy or download<br>
3.        If your provider is unable to upload your test certificate on your behalf you should enter your TT or BIOMARS code from your PCR certificate, or upload the certificate yourself. You can do that by selecting at any other lab instead of lab tests (TT)<br>
4.        We also recommend travelling with hard copy proof of this negative Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test result<br>
Children under the age of 5 are exempt from needing a pre-departure test. For passengers who have transited other countries before arriving in Ghana, the first country of departure will be the reference point.<br>
*Additional forms and checks before arrival: Travellers are also required by the Government of Ghana to:<br>
•        Pay for the on arrival COVID-19 test. It is $150 per passenger. Children under the age of 5 are exempt. Children aged 5 to 12 will be tested free of charge. Details of test below;<br>
•        Next complete a health declaration form. You need the code generated by payment for the test to do that. You will also need to complete a separate health declaration form for any children aged 5 to 12. All passengers may also be asked to complete hard copy self-declaration forms on the flight, confirming they are fit to travel and providing details to facilitate contact tracing;<br>
•        Generate a Travel Certificate;<br>
•        All of these steps are completed online <a href=""https://www.ghs-hdf.org/"">here</a> <br>
*On Arrival: Wear a face-mask at all times at the airport:<br>
•        Undergo a temperature check;<br>
•        Take a mandatory COVID-19. The test is an antigen fluorescent immunoassay test and it will be conducted before baggage is collected at a cost of $150 per passenger. Payment should be made <a href=""https://myfrontierhealthcare.com/"">online</a> prior to boarding. Children under the age of five are exempt. Children aged 5-12 will be tested on arrival free of charge.<br>
During busy periods when there may be a large number of passengers disembarking at the same time the testing area may become busy. Test results are normally ready within one hour, depending how busy the airport is. The pre departure area where test results are collected can also get busy. You can check your results <a href=""https://www.ghs-hdf.org/"">online</a> while you wait. Be prepared for additional time to move through and exit the airport.<br>
*Quarantine requirements: All arriving passengers should be prepared to comply with Ghana’s COVID-19 Health Protocols.<br>
Those that test positive for COVID-19 on arrival will be assessed by the Port Health Unit for either quarantine in a Government Health facility or for home isolation subject to strict monitoring to ensure compliance to the protocols. Quarantine and / or medical costs can be expensive so it is important that all passengers arrive with adequate access to financial resources. In these circumstances a PCR test is normally carried out on day three. That test result will normally be ready within 48 hours. Passports of those who test positive are likely to be retained by Ghana Immigration Services for the duration of isolation. The quarantine process is managed by Ghana Health Service.<br>
The Government of Ghana also advise that all arrivals should have valid insurance. It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover.<br>

<a href=""https://www.visitazores.com/en/trip-info"">Visit Azores official website</a>.
*Public spaces and services: Mainland Portugal: Mainland Portugal is in a state of calamity. There is a ban on drinking alcohol outside in public and a requirement to show vaccination and negative COVID-19 test certificates to access services and facilities, as follows: <br>
•        On entry to hotels and other tourist accommodation, restaurants, casinos, gyms and events and shows with reserved seating, you will be asked to show a COVID-19 vaccination or recovery certificate, or <br>

 *Travel in Qatar: Qatar’s  <ahref=""https://www.moph.gov.qa/english/Pages/Coronavirus2019.aspx"">Ministry of Public Health</a> has published advice on how to limit the spread of coronavirus, and has introduced a number of precautionary restrictions on travel and events in response to the coronavirus pandemic. <br>
Public transport, including the metro and bus services, operates with a restricted 75% capacity from 3 October 2021. You should wear a mask at all times when using these services. No more than four people are allowed in a vehicle, if they are not part of the same family. The authorities may also stop vehicles to enquire about the reason for the journey. <br>
With effect from 3 October 2021, the requirement to wear facemasks has been relaxed in certain conditions. It is no longer a requirement to wear your mask in open spaces, except when attending organised public events such as markets. You are still required to wear facemasks in places such as mosques, hospitals, schools/universities and shopping malls. <br>
It is compulsory to have Qatar’s contact tracing app, Ehteraz, downloaded and working on your smartphone whenever you leave the house. The authorities are deploying mobile patrols and setting up checkpoints to prevent social gatherings and check compliance with other measures. <br>
Anyone violating these could incur a fine of up to QAR200,000 and/or a prison sentence not exceeding three years. <br>

*Public places and services: With effect from 3 October 2021 restrictions on the number of people at gatherings have eased. Indoors, a maximum of 30 vaccinated people can gather in a group. If there is an unvaccinated person in the group, that limit drops to five people. Outdoors, a maximum of 50 vaccinated people can gather in a group. If there is an unvaccinated person in the group, that limit drops to ten people. Capacity restrictions also apply in restaurants, malls, hairdressers and outdoor swimming pools. <br>
You will be asked to show your vaccinated status on the Ehteraz app to enter most locations. If you are unvaccinated, entry may be denied. Playgrounds and exercise equipment in public spaces have been reopened, operating on a restricted capacity basis. Restrictions in mosques have eased but worshippers are reminded to follow the guidance on social distance, mask wearing and general prevention measures. Entry may be dependent on presenting evidence that you are fully vaccinated. <br>

International Restrictions: <br>
*Transiting in South Korea: All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). <br>
Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport. <br>
*Testing on arrival: All foreign nationals (except children under 6) arriving in South Korea are required to provide a negative PCR test declaration. From 13 January 2022, South Korea requires that the test must have been taken within the 72 hours prior to departure. (Prior to 13 January, the test must have been issued within the 72 hours prior to departure.). <br>
All arrivals – including children under 6, and regardless of nationality and length of stay – are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) within 24 hours after entering South Korea. If you are not resident in South Korea, you will be taken for testing and must remain at the testing facility until a negative result has been secured. <br>
*Quarantine and quarantine exemptions: The default requirement when entering South Korea is to quarantine for 10 days at home (if you are resident in South Korea) or in a government quarantine facility (if you are visiting). You can avoid quarantine entirely if you have a ‘quarantine exemption’. If you’re visiting, you can quarantine with relatives if you can prove your relationship to them and if their accommodation meets certain standards. <br>
You can apply for a quarantine exemption if you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The process of applying for a quarantine exemption varies depending on where you were vaccinated and the purpose of your travel. <br>
Most quarantine exemptions are currently suspended to control the spread of the omicron variant, regardless of your nationality or vaccination status. If you arrive in South Korea without a valid quarantine exemption you will need to quarantine for 10 days. <br>
Quarantine exemptions will continue to be issued only if you are resident outside of South Korea, and only for business and academic travellers, government officials, or if you are travelling to Korea for the funeral of a close family member. You can apply for a quarantine exemption via the Korean Embassy in the country where you were vaccinated. “Family member” is defined as your spouse, a sibling of you or your spouse, or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren) of you or your spouse. Any family relationship certificates (i.e. marriage or birth certificates) that you submit as part of your application need to be legalised (or “apostilled”) by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office before you submit them. South Korea does not accept marriage certificates or civil partnership documents between same-sex partners for the purposes of applying for a quarantine exemption. If you are travelling for business or academic purposes, you need to obtain special approval from the relevant Korean ministries; if you are travelling for business, your employer can apply through the <a href=""http://www.btsc.or.kr/"">Business Support Centre</a> (in Korean). <br>
Even if you have a quarantine exemption, on arrival in Korea you will need to submit a negative PCR test taken within the 72 hours prior to your departure. (Pre-departure tests are not required for children under 6). You will also need to take PCR tests within 24 hours of your arrival and on day 10, and comply with active health monitoring through the Korean government app. <br>
Quarantine is mandatory if you do not have a quarantine exemption. Korean nationals and long-term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence may self-quarantine at home for 10 days. <br>
Foreign short-term travellers may be able to quarantine with family members under specific circumstances. Your family member must be your spouse or a direct ascendent or descendent (a parent/grandparent or a child/grandchild, not a sibling) and must be resident in Korea (i.e. a Korean national or a foreigner with a long-term stay visa). You must be able to prove your family relationship, for example by showing your ID, a copy of your family member’s Korean ID, and a marriage or birth certificate, which must be legalised (or “apostilled. Certified translations are required for documents not in English.) Your family’s accommodation must meet certain basic standards (typically, they must have a separate bedroom and a separate bathroom for you). Your family must also be available to pick you up from the airport or the quarantine facility. These rules may change at short notice – your family member in Korea should double-check the rules before you travel by calling the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 (support is available in English). <br>
All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for 10 days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 120,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19 on arrival, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. <br>
For more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 from inside South Korea (support is available in English). <br>
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: For the purposes of applying for an exemption from quarantine, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Data collection: Individuals from the UK will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile app. <br>
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea. <br>
During your quarantine period, the location of your mobile phone will be tracked, and you will be contacted if you leave the place where you are quarantining.<br>
   <br>
  <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19: If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Outdoor sites where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. Results are usually issued via text message within 1-2 days. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. If you have no or mild symptoms you will generally be eligible for treatment at home, unless you suffer from certain medical conditions or are unable to sufficiently isolate from others. If you do not meet the criteria for treatment at home, you will be moved to a quarantine centre or a hospital/treatment centre until you have received two consecutive negative tests. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures. <br>
Some individuals testing positive have, in the past, spent over a month in hospital/ treatment centres before testing negative and being discharged. You may face additional costs if you have to rearrange your travel. <br>
Anyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for the cost of your treatment and for any economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Face masks are compulsory in public places and on public transport. Failure to wear a mask can result in a fine of up to 100,000 Korean Won. <br>

•        Keeping a distance of at least 1.5 metres from other people<br>
•        If it is not possible to maintain that distance, wearing a face mask<br>
The requirement to wear a mask applies in all situations where a certificate requirement applies, including public transport and indoors in publicly accessible areas - except at private gatherings. Further information on masks is available on the <a href=""https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/masken.html#11550956"">Federal Office of Public Health website</a>. Failure to wear a mask is punishable by a fine. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from this requirement, as are individuals who are unable to wear a mask for medical reasons.<br>
Proof of vaccination, proof of recovery from a COVID-19 infection or a negative test result (up to 48 hours for a rapid antigen test or 72 hours for a PCR test) is required for entry into:<br>

This also includes the European Union Digital COVID Certificate. Other accepted methods of proof include a printout of a COVID-19 vaccination record or a COVID-19 vaccination certificate issued at national or subnational level or by an authorized vaccine provider. Alternatively, digital photos of a vaccination card or record, a downloaded vaccine record or a vaccination certificate from an official source (e.g. public health agency, government agency, or other authorised vaccine provider), or a mobile phone application without a QR code. All forms of COVID-19 status must have a personal identifier, at a minimum including full name and date of birth, that match the information on a passenger’s passport or other travel documents.

<br>
<br>
Internal Restrictions:
Given what we [the CDC] currently know about COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, CDC is shortening the recommended time for isolation from 10 days for people with COVID-19 to five days, if asymptomatic, followed by five days of wearing a mask when around others. Additionally, CDC is updating the recommended quarantine period for those exposed to COVID-19. For people who are unvaccinated or are more than six months out from their second mRNA dose (or more than two months after the J&J vaccine) and not yet boosted, CDC now recommends quarantine for five days followed by strict mask use for an additional five days. Alternatively, if a five-day quarantine is not feasible, it is imperative that an exposed person wear a well-fitting mask at all times when around others for 10 days after exposure. Individuals who have received their booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure, but should wear a mask for 10 days after the exposure. For all those exposed, best practice would also include a test for SARS-CoV-2 at day five after exposure. If symptoms occur, individuals should immediately quarantine until a negative test confirms symptoms are not attributable to COVID-19.<br>
.*Travel in USA: Many airports in the USA have implemented safety measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting to see how these could affect you. <br>
On 21 January 2021 President Biden signed an Executive Order requiring masks to be worn on airplanes, trains, buses and at airports. <br>
Some states have rules in place requiring travellers from other states, with high rates of COVID-19, to quarantine or to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Before travelling you should check the websites of the relevant state governments. Further information can be found on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html"">CDC website</a>.
A number of US states have mandated the use of masks and face coverings while in public. These will vary from state to state and there can often be different rules within different localities in the same state. You should consult the website of the state or city to which you are travelling. Further details are found on the <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/states-and-territories"">US.GOV site</a>. Penalties for breaches of regulations will vary between each state and may sometimes vary in different areas in the same state. <br>
Some areas require proof of vaccination in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children 17 and under may not be exempt from this requirement. With rising COVID cases across the country, many private venues, including restaurants and concert halls, are making proof of vaccination (or a recent negative COVID-19 test result) a requirement for entry. The precise requirements may vary from venue to venue so you should check on compliancy requirements in advance. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels will be operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations. <br>
*Public places and services: Local regulations on shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities may be following measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Some areas require proof of vaccination or evidence of a negative COVID-19 test in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children 17 and under may not be exempt from this requirement. <br>
You should be aware that public places likely to attract large crowds may be closed at short notice. You should follow local media and any guidance issued by local authorities. <br>
On 9 September 2021 President Biden announced details of a 6-pronged national COVID-19 action plan. This includes requiring all employers with over 100 employees to ensure their workers are vaccinated or tested weekly. You can find details and requirements of the White House COVID-19 plan on the <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/"">White House website</a>.
*If you test positive while in the USA you will be required to quarantine in a private area, likely a hotel or private residence. The length of time will depend on the guidance in the state where you are residing. This applies to those under 18 as well. You may also be contacted by local authorities to advise to isolate if you were in close contact with someone else who tested positive. Any assistance for those required to isolate will depend on the local authority. You should check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-planner/index.html"">travel planner </a>to verify local state guidance.

*Entry to Vietnam: Vietnam has suspended visa waivers, issuing of visas and the entry into Vietnam for all foreign nationals. There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers. These will be processed on a case by case basis.
